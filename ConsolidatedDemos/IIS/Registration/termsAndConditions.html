                        consented to receive a One-Time Password via SMS text on your mobile telecommunications device from Client

                        (‘us’ or ‘we’ or ‘our’) for enhanced user authentication and payment security purposes regarding your account.

                        The OTP may be accompanied by an advertisement. You acknowledge, understand and agree as follows:

                    <p>
                        Messages sent via SMS may not be delivered to you if your phone is not in range of a transmission site, or if

                        sufficient network capacity is not available at a particular time. Even within a coverage area, factors beyond the

                        control of your wireless carrier may interfere with message delivery, including the customer’s equipment, terrain,

                        proximity to buildings, foliage, and weather. You acknowledge that urgent alerts may not be timely received and

                        that your wireless carrier does not guarantee that alerts will be delivered.
